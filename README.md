A small clone of Flappy Bird in 3D which I made in a few hours.
Tested on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.10/14.04

Have fun with that code =)


Requirements
============
* CPU @ 1Ghz should be enough
* 256MB RAM is probably more than enough
* GeForce 6200 or better (any GPU that supports OpenGL 2.0 or newer)
* Ubuntu (linux) needs OpenAL packages: libalut0, libopenal1 (terminal: sudo apt-get install libalut0 libopenal1)
* Windows requires installing OpenAL ( http://braxi.boo.pl/download/oalinst.exe )
